# MorseCode
the word "Welcome" is transformed into morse code by the use of an led,  on the beagle bone black microcontroller.
morse code only uses two characters to represent each word(".","-"). the dot is represented by putting the led high for 0.5s, the dash is represented by putting the led high for 1.5s.
